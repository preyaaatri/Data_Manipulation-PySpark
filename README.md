## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

The purpose of this project was to simplify the environment setup for PySpark and perform Data Manipulation tasks on Nested JSON data.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To run this project you need basic understanding of Jupyter and PySpark.

### Prerequisites

Install Docker to run this project as it spins on a jupyter project setup.

### Installing

The environment has to be setup by running the makefile.

``` make run ```

The above command will spin up a docker container and provide the link to use jupyter
Once you open the jupyter link you can open ```DM_project.ipynb```
The above mentioned file contains a commented code for the project. 
By default, the file will be opened in ``` Python 3 ``` kernal. Please change the kernal to: ``` spylon-kernal```



## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Since the code is running inside a docker container, the data is not persistent. The sole purpose of this setup 
is to get your environment setup for running a PySpark project in Jupyter. 

## 🚀 Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

To deploy the project, you can run you code on the jupyter tool and save the file inside app folder to reuse it.
